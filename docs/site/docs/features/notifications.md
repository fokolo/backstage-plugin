# Notifications

Notifications allow you to configure alerts and messages that are triggered by events in your software catalog. They help keep team members informed about important changes and updates without requiring constant manual monitoring.

## Overview

A notification consists of two main parts:

1. **Trigger** - The event that initiates the notification
2. **Channel** - The destination where the notification will be sent (e.g., Slack, email, webhook)

## Available Triggers

For triggers, please refer to the [automations documentation](./automations.md).

## Available Channels

For channels you basically choose where to send the notification.
The backend from sending the notification can be a Github action, webhook url and more...
