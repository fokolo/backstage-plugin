# Plugin catalog

You can build a catalog of the plugins that you have installed in your Backstage instance.
The catalog will contain:

- A list of all the plugins that you have installed
- A search bar to search for plugins
- A scorecard for each plugin that will show you the status of the plugin
- A status indicator for each plugin
- A kill switch to disable a plugin
